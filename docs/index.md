# TIA HMI Simulation

This application is a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) simulation designed for use with PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) in a TIA (Totally Integrated Automation) environment. It provides a virtual platform for developing, testing, and demonstrating HMI screens and controls without the need for physical hardware.

## Key Features

- Simulates a PLC-connected HMI panel for industrial automation scenarios
- Includes interactive pages such as Motor Controls, System Info, and more
- Visualizes real-time control states (e.g., motor on/off, direction, error)
- Supports user interaction via sliders, buttons, and touch events

## Typical Use Cases

- Practice and learn embedded programming concepts using STM32 microcontrollers
- Experiment with HMI and PLC integration in a simulated environment
- Build foundational skills for real-world industrial automation projects
- Demonstrate embedded programming techniques to peers or instructors
